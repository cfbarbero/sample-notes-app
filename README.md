# Devops Interview Technical Question

We have a simple NodeJS API with an exposed endpoint that requests data from a Postgres DB, which has a schema and seed file. The current engineers think having to start up the different services each time they want to work on the application is slowing them down. Additionally, they are using different versions of locally installed Postgres.
- How would you help standardize the local environment to facilicate more efficient development?
- Which values need to be moved from the code -> configuraiton?
- What are some best practices you'd recommend following?
  - How would you approach the application engineers to implement them?
